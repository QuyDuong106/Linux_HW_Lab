# Hands-on Lab: Installing and working with text editors
## 1. Using nano, edit your new hello_world.txt file to add a new line containing the following text:
```
theia@theia-quyduong106:/home/project$ nano hello_world.txt
theia@theia-quyduong106:/home/project$ cat hello_world.txt
Hello world!
This is the second line of my first-ever text file created with nano
This is the thirid line of my new line
```

## 2. Using Vim, create a file called done.txt that prints "I am done with the lab!" when you execute the file with Bas
```
theia@theia-quyduong106:/home/project$ vim done.txt
theia@theia-quyduong106:/home/project$ cat done.txt
I am done with the lab
```
